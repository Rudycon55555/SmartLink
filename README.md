# SmartLink

SmartLink is a modern Flutter app that lets you **connect APIs, smart devices, and smart controllers** into one unified dashboard. Configure endpoints, protocols, and keys once, and SmartLink gives you persistent connections with rich charts, interactive controls, and quick send‑back panels.
